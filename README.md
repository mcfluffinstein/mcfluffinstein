## 👋 Hey, I'm Alex @mcfluffinstein

I work as an Enterprise Support Engineer at GitHub :octocat: My focus is on the Ecosystem, Access and Infrastucture squads. I'm passionate about finding creative solutions to problems and building my technical skillset 🌱 Outside of work, you'll find me rock climbing, stargazing or picking up new programming languages 👨‍🚀 Here's what I'm currently learning:

* Bash/shell scripting 
* Python
* Ruby
* IaC Tools: Chef, Puppet and Terraform
* GraphQL and REST APIs
* Docker and Kubernetes
