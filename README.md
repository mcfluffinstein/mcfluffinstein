## 👋 Hey, I'm Alex @mcfluffinstein

I'm working in the Enterprise Support team at GitHub :octocat: My focus is on the Ecosystem, Infrastucture and Access squads. I'm passionate about finding creative solutions to problems and building my technical skillset 🌱 

Outside of work, you'll find me rock climbing, stargazing or picking up new programming languages 👨‍🚀 Here's a quick summary of what I'm currently learning:

* Shell scripting 
* Python
* Ruby
* Studying for CompTIA Linux+
